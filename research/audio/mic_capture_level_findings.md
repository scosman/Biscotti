# Mic capture level findings — quiet built-in mic during meetings

**Status:** active investigation (AudioLab experiment). **Hardware:** Apple-silicon
MacBook, macOS 15+. **Date:** 2026-06-08.

This documents why the built-in microphone, captured via `AVCaptureSession`,
records **extremely quiet** audio while a meeting app is running — and the ranked
plan for fixing it. It is a follow-on to the Phase 9 validation
([`phase9_validation_findings.md`](phase9_validation_findings.md)).

---

## Symptom

Recording the built-in mic ("MacBook Pro Microphone") via `AVCaptureSession` +
`AVCaptureAudioDataOutput` while a meeting app (FaceTime; or a browser meeting
whose audio process is `com.apple.WebKit.GPU`; Siri/`com.apple.CoreSpeech` also
present) is active produces a **valid but near-silent** file: peak |sample|
~0.003–0.005 (≈ **−48 dBFS**) during normal speech. Without a meeting app, levels
were fine.

Instrumented logs (AudioLab `MicCapture`) established the chain precisely:
- The device delivers a **3-channel, 44.1 kHz, non-interleaved float32** stream
  (a beamforming mic array). All three channels carry **similar, low** signal
  (`ch0≈ch1≈ch2≈0.004`) — so it is **not** a "only one channel has the audio"
  problem, and averaging is not what kills the level.
- Two earlier *crash/empty-file* bugs on this path were already fixed (see
  "Prior fixes" below); the remaining issue is purely **level**.

---

## Root cause

**Primary: the built-in mic's multichannel stream is the raw beamformer element
taps, which have tiny intrinsic gain.** The loud, normalized, noise-suppressed,
echo-cancelled signal a user expects only exists *after* Apple's voice-processing
pipeline (**VoiceProcessingIO / VPIO**) collapses the array to a single processed
channel. The raw array appears to be **designed for Apple's own stream
processing, not general-purpose taps**. When another app engages voice processing
the device stays in this 3-channel array mode, and a plain (non-VP) capture client
like ours is handed the raw, quiet taps. Us being switched onto that device format
is a gnarly side effect, not the intended use.

**Secondary (minor): voice-processing apps also AGC-duck the shared input gain.**
Measured via `kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` (input scope): **vol=0.27 with
Google Meet in a call vs. vol=0.67 idle** (cf. WebKit Bug 218012). This compounds
the quietness but is **not the main cause** — forcing the HAL input volume back to
1.0 did **not** meaningfully restore the level (tested in AudioLab and reverted).
The dominant factor is the raw-array gain itself.

### Evidence
- Logs: `src=[44100Hz 3ch …]`, `heartbeat src channel peaks: ch0=0.0033 ch1=0.0034 ch2=0.0045`, `outPeak=0.0036`.
- `default-input … vol=0.27` (Meet) vs `vol=0.67` (idle).
- Forcing `kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` input → 1.0 each heartbeat: little effect.
- See memory: `macos-mic-agc-ducking-measured`.

## Remaining approaches — try in this order

### 1. VPIO path (preferred — gives the *processed* mono we actually want)
Capture the mic as a **first-class VoiceProcessingIO client** via
`AVAudioEngine`'s `inputNode.setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)`. This is the only
route to the loud, beamformed, echo-cancelled **mono** signal (the "after"
processed audio), and it inherently handles the meeting-app-contention case
because we become a proper VP client.

Known gotchas (from the **Scripta** precedent, a whisper.cpp macOS meeting
recorder — [dev.to/thehwang](https://dev.to/thehwang/building-a-100-local-meeting-transcription-app-for-macos-with-whispercpp-and-screencapturekit-33m7)):
- **VPIO silently changes the mic format to 9 channels.** Extract **channel 0**
  manually — do **not** rely on `AVAudioConverter` for the channel reduction (it
  crashed on the real-time audio thread). See memory `scripta-vpio-9-channel-format`.
- Disable ducking of other audio:
  `inputNode.voiceProcessingOtherAudioDuckingConfiguration = .init(enableAdvancedDucking: false, duckingLevel: .min)`.

**Risk:** VPIO previously *faulted* on this hardware (board-ID / DSP
`state fault`; see `phase9_validation_findings.md` finding #1). That failure is
unrelated to the 3-channel/format issues and may recur — so **timebox a spike** to
confirm VPIO initializes on the current OS before committing. If it faults, fall
back to #2.

### 2. Software makeup gain on the current AVCaptureSession path (pragmatic fallback)
Apply a fixed digital gain in the sample pipeline (after the manual mono downmix,
before write), e.g. ~+20–30 dB, clamped to [−1, 1]. Fast and self-contained, but
**amplifies quiet, noisy, non-AEC raw audio** and is still subject to the AGC duck
under contention. Acceptable as an interim to get usable levels; not the processed
signal. (`AVCaptureAudioChannel.volume` supports >1.0 on macOS but may only apply
to file/preview outputs, not the data-output delegate path — verify before
relying on it; otherwise multiply samples directly.)

### 3. Audio-Hijack-style: process taps + makeup-gain blocks (most robust, most work)
Mirror how Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack handles capture: Core Audio **process taps**
into a private aggregate device read via an IOProc, with explicit **gain/"Magic
Boost" blocks** in the signal chain for level correction
([Rogue Amoeba KB](https://rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=Misc-ARK-Audio-Capture-Details&product=Audio+Hijack)).
Krisp goes further with a virtual HAL device (`AudioServerPlugin`) that owns the
hardware as sole client
([Krisp KB](https://help.krisp.ai/hc/en-us/articles/4402174576402-How-Krisp-Microphone-and-Krisp-Speaker-work)).
Highest implementation cost (and a virtual device requires user plugin approval),
but fully sidesteps contention/ducking.

## Prior fixes on this path (already landed)
- 3-channel format dropped every buffer: `AVAudioFormat(streamDescription:)`
  returns nil for >2 channels without a channel layout → empty file. Fixed by
  attaching the `CMFormatDescription`'s channel layout.
- Discrete 3ch→mono via `AVAudioConverter` produced **silence** (no error). Fixed
  by manual averaging downmix at the source rate, then mono→mono resample.
- Extensive diagnostics added (per-subsystem `os.Logger`, heartbeat with
  buffer/frame counters + per-channel input peaks + output peak, stall/no-data
  watchdogs, device + input-volume introspection).
